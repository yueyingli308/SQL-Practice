SET @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3 =0, @r4=0;

##### 这里case 列名
                when 值 then ...
      是case when... then... 的简单写法

prac:
set @r1=0, @r2=0,..;  分号记得！
select min(doc),min(act),.. from
(select case occupation when 'Doctor' then @r1:=@r1+1
                        when 'Prof' then @r2:=@r2+1
                        ......
 as rowline,
 case when Occupation = 'Doctor' then name end as Doctor,
 case when ...
 from occupations
 order by names ) as t
 group by rowline ;
